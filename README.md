# quality-prediction-ore-mining
The main goal is to use this data to predict how much impurity is in the ore concentrate. If we can predict how much silica (impurity) is in the ore concentrate, we can help the engineers, giving them early information to take actions (empowering!). Hence, they will be able to take corrective actions in advance (reduce impurity, if it is the case) and also help the environment (reducing the amount of ore that goes to tailings as you reduce silica in the ore concentrate).In this hands-on project, we will train machine learning and deep learning models to predict the % of Silica Concentrate in the iron per minute. This project could be practically used in Mining Industry to get the % Silica Concentrate at much faster rate compared to traditional methods.
